//! Parses the dashboard's JavaScript and fails the build on any syntax error.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `static/` is served straight off disk by `ServeDir` (`lib.rs`) and is never compiled, linted, or
//! executed by anything else in this repository. That leaves a gap nothing else can cover: a syntax
//! error in `app.js` is invisible to `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test` and the entire
//! `test_e2e.sh` suite, all of which exercise the HTTP API and never parse the file they are serving.
//!
//! That is not hypothetical. Commit `4bdadf0` shipped an `app.js` that could not be parsed at all —
//! a stray backtick inside a template literal terminated the string early — and every one of those
//! gates passed. The dashboard was completely dead in the browser; the first thing to notice was a
//! human opening it.
//!
//! # Why a parser and not an engine
//!
//! `oxc_parser` parses without executing. Running the file instead would immediately fail on
//! `document`, `localStorage` and `crypto.subtle`, none of which exist outside a browser, and
//! distinguishing "this is not valid JavaScript" from "this needs a DOM" would mean pattern-matching
//! on error text. Parsing answers exactly the question worth asking here.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Syntax only. This says nothing about whether the code *works* — a typo'd identifier, a wrong
//! selector, or a broken event wiring all parse cleanly. It closes the "the file cannot load at all"
//! class of failure, which is the one that takes the whole dashboard down at once.
