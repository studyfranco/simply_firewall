//! Single-use enforcement for `CANONICAL_V1` request signatures.
//!
//! The timestamp window in [`crate::middleware`] bounds *how long* a captured request stays useful;
//! it does nothing about that request being used more than once inside the window. Those are
//! different properties, and only the second one is replay protection in the sense an attacker
//! cares about: anyone who observes one authentic signed request — a mirrored packet on a
//! plain-HTTP LAN link, a reverse-proxy access log, a debug trace — can resend those exact bytes
//! for the rest of the window. Every field the signature covers is unchanged, so the HMAC verifies
//! and the freshness check passes. For `POST /api/ban` that is a duplicate row; for anything
//! non-idempotent it is a repeated side effect the caller never asked for.
//!
//! [`ReplayGuard`] closes that by remembering which signatures have already been accepted and
//! refusing a second use. A signature is only ever recorded **after** it has been verified, which is
//! what keeps this from becoming a memory-exhaustion target: filling the map requires producing
//! valid HMACs, which requires the signing secret.
//!
//! This module was extracted from `crate::state` and rebuilt during the 2026-08-02 cross-audit
//! follow-up. Three properties changed, each closing a defect the audit found:
//!
//! - **Monotonic expiry.** Entries expire against [`tokio::time::Instant`] rather than
//!   `chrono::Utc::now()`. The previous wall-clock arithmetic (`(now - ts).abs() <= window`) evicted
//!   still-valid entries whenever the system clock stepped in *either* direction, which is precisely
//!   the moment — an NTP correction — when an operator is least likely to connect the two events.
//! - **Amortized sweeping.** Pruning runs on an interval instead of scanning the whole map on every
//!   request while holding the global lock every request must take.
//! - **Graceful saturation.** Reaching the ceiling triggers a sweep and a warning, never a
//!   `clear()`. Flushing the map would make every signature accepted in the current window
//!   replayable at once — and because the map is process-global, one key's burst would have
//!   disabled the guard for every other key.
