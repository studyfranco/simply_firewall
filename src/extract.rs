//! Request extractors that make a rejection a property of the **type**, not of a handler.
//!
//! `RBAC_MODEL.md` §5 draws the distinction this module exists for: "Removing the field from the
//! payload type is required; rejecting it at the handler is not sufficient, since a later handler can
//! reintroduce the path."
//!
//! Deleting a field from a payload struct is only half of that. Serde's default is to *ignore*
//! unknown fields, so a struct without `is_master` accepts `{"is_master": true}` and silently drops
//! it — which is worse than the handler check it replaced, because nothing refuses and nothing logs.
//! `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` is what turns the field's absence into a refusal, and
//! [`StrictJson`] is what turns that refusal into the same `400` the handler used to produce.

/// [`Json`], with deserialization failures reported as [`AppError::InvalidInput`] (`400`) instead of
/// axum's default `422`.
///
/// # Why not just use `Json`
///
/// Two reasons, and only the second is about status codes.
///
/// The first is that a rejection carrying serde's own message is *evidence of where the refusal
/// happened*. When a payload struct denies unknown fields, the body text names the field
/// (``unknown field `is_master` ``), which a test can distinguish from a handler's hand-written
/// message. That is what lets the compliance suite assert the control lives in the type rather than
/// in a guard some future edit could drop — an assertion it could not otherwise make, since both
/// spellings produce the same status.
///
/// The second is continuity: these endpoints answered `400` for a rejected field before the check
/// moved into the type, and moving a control inward should not change what a client sees.
///
/// # Only the content errors are remapped
///
/// A blanket "every rejection becomes `400`" would be wrong, and quietly so. The router-wide body
/// limit surfaces here as a `JsonRejection` too, and collapsing it would demote `413 Payload Too
/// Large` into an indistinguishable bad request — a caller that sent 4 MiB would be told its *fields*
/// were wrong. So the remap covers exactly the two variants that mean "we read the body and would not
/// accept it", and every other rejection keeps the status axum chose.
///
/// `simply_hook_executor` passes every status through, including for a rejected field, so a payload
/// carrying `is_master` answers `422` there and `400` here. Deliberate, and the one divergence in
/// this file: this service documented `400` for that case before the control moved into the type.

/// body at all — it is a question, and the answer is §6's pre-flight inventory of owned entities —
/// while the resubmission carries the resolution map. Axum's `Json` rejects an empty body outright,
/// and its `Option<Json<T>>` keys on `Content-Type` rather than on emptiness, so neither expresses
/// "absent means take no action". Demanding a literal `{}` on the first request would make the
/// common case — deleting a key that owns nothing — require a body for no reason, and would break
/// every existing client, since `DELETE` has always been callable bodyless.
///
/// # Why an extractor rather than parsing `Bytes` in the handler
///
/// It replaces exactly that: `delete_api_key` took `body: axum::body::Bytes` and called
/// `serde_json::from_slice` itself. Two things were wrong with it, and neither was visible at the
/// call site. The hand-rolled parse could not be reused, so the next bodyless endpoint would copy
/// it; and being outside the extractor layer, it was the one JSON path in the service whose
/// rejection shape nothing enforced. Moving it into a type puts the decision where
/// [`StrictJson`]'s module header says such decisions belong — in the type, not in a handler a later
/// edit can quietly rewrite.
///
/// # Emptiness is decided from the bytes
///
/// Not from `Content-Type`, so a client that sends the header without a payload behaves exactly like
/// one that sends neither. Reading through [`Bytes`] keeps the request under the router's
/// [`DefaultBodyLimit`](axum::extract::DefaultBodyLimit), so the `413` control still applies here as
/// it does everywhere else — and, as in [`StrictJson`], that status is passed through rather than
/// flattened into a `400`.
