/// - `X-Timestamp` — current UTC Unix time in seconds; must be within
///   [`MAX_TIMESTAMP_SKEW_SECS`] of the server's clock or the request is rejected as a replay.
/// - `X-Signature-256` — `sha256=<hex>`, an HMAC-SHA256 over `METHOD\nTARGET\nTIMESTAMP\nRAW_BODY`
///   keyed with the looked-up key's `signing_secret`, where `TARGET` is the full request target
///   **including the query string**. The `sha256=` prefix is **required**; a bare hex digest is
///   rejected. See [`crypto::verify_signature`].
///
/// This is **unconditional for every key**. There is no per-key mode, no `REQUIRE_SIGNED_REQUESTS`
/// switch, and no route that opts out — `simply_ip_vault` is the internal, higher-trust half of the
/// pair and never speaks to third-party senders, so there is no interoperability argument for a
/// weaker posture. Callers are shell scripts (fail2ban, portsentry) that compute this with one
/// `openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac`, which is not an operational burden worth trading authentication
/// for. `simply_hook_executor` keeps a per-key configurable posture for the opposite reason; that
/// asymmetry is intentional.
///
/// # Ordering: authenticate, then authorize
///
/// 1. Resolve the client IP (no I/O beyond a possible cached DNS lookup).
/// 2. Validate `X-Timestamp` — no database round-trip, so a stale or absent timestamp costs an
///    unauthenticated caller nothing of ours.
/// 3. Look up the key by hash.
/// 4. Buffer the body and verify the HMAC.
/// 5. Reject a signature already seen inside the window (replay).
/// 6. **Only then** check `bound_ips`.
///
/// Step 6 must stay last. Running the network-binding check before the signature would let a caller
/// who cannot prove possession of the signing secret learn, from the `403`-vs-`401` distinction
/// alone, whether a key it merely guessed is bound to the caller's own network — an oracle that
/// turns key guessing into key *mapping*. Both failures must be indistinguishable until the caller
/// has proven it holds the secret.
