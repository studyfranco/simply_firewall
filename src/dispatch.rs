//! The outbound webhook dispatcher: the background worker that *sends* notifications.
//!
//! # Why this is `dispatch` and not `webhooks`
//!
//! It was `src/webhooks.rs` until the structural audit, which sat one directory away from
//! `src/api/webhooks.rs` — and the two do entirely different jobs. That module is the CRUD surface
//! for webhook **configuration**: a caller creating, listing, and deleting `webhook_config` rows.
//! This one is the **runtime**: it consumes [`WebhookEvent`]s off a channel, resolves each target
//! against the SSRF filter below, signs the body, and makes the outbound HTTP call. Nothing here
//! serves a request, and nothing in `api/webhooks.rs` ever sends one.
//!
//! Two files with the same name whose only distinction was a path prefix is the shape that gets
//! imported wrongly — and, worse, *reviewed* wrongly, because a diff header reading `webhooks.rs`
//! does not say which of the two security models applies.
