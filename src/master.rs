//! Boot-time pinning of the Master key **identity**, and the demotion that enforces it.
//!
//! # The attack this closes
//!
//! `api_keys.is_master` is a column, and every authorization guard in `src/api/` branches on it.
//! Anyone who reaches the database — a restored backup, a stray migration, an operator with a
//! sqlite3 prompt, a second process sharing the file — needs one statement to become Master:
//!
//! ```sql
//! UPDATE api_keys SET is_master = true WHERE id = '<attacker key>';
//! ```
//!
//! `RBAC_MODEL.md` §5's uniqueness index does not close that, and the reason is worth stating
//! precisely because it is the whole justification for this module. The index guarantees *at most
//! one* row carries `is_master`. It says nothing about **which** row. An attacker does not need two
//! masters: demoting the real one and promoting itself keeps the count at exactly one and leaves
//! every constraint satisfied. **Uniqueness and identity are different properties**, and the index
//! only defends the first.
//!
//! So the identity is resolved **once**, at startup, from a database whose §5 invariants are checked
//! at that moment, and then held for the life of the process. Afterwards `is_master` on any other row
//! is inert — noticed, logged loudly, and ignored. Making it mean something again requires a restart,
//! which is an event an operator can see and which re-runs every assertion below.
//!
//! # What this does not claim
//!
//! It is not a defence against an attacker who can write the database *and* restart the service, nor
//! against one who repoints an existing Master row's `key_hash` at a credential they hold. Nothing at
//! this layer could be. It closes the cheap, silent, otherwise invisible escalation of flipping a
//! boolean on a row you already control.
