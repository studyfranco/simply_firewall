//! Renames `webhook_executions.error_message` to `response_body`.
//!
//! # Why this is a rename, not a new column
//!
//! Until this migration, the column was populated only on failure — with a computed string like
//! `"HTTP 500"`, not the receiver's actual response — and left `NULL` on success even when the
//! receiver returned a body worth keeping (a JSON acknowledgement, a tracking id, a human-readable
//! confirmation). Both of those were narrower than what the column's data actually is: whatever the
//! receiver said back, on every attempt that reached the network, success or failure alike. Adding
//! a second column would have left two overlapping "what did the receiver say" fields with no clean
//! rule for which one a reader should trust; renaming and re-scoping the existing one keeps there
//! being exactly one place to look.
//!
//! `dispatch::log_execution`'s caller now passes the actual response body (truncated, see
//! `dispatch::RESPONSE_SNIPPET_MAX_BYTES`) whenever a response was received at all, falling back to
//! the failure reason only when no response ever arrived (a network-level error, a timeout) — there
//! is no body to have kept in that case.
