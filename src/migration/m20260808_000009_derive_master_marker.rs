//! Replaces the hand-maintained `api_keys.master_marker` with one the **database engine derives**
//! from `is_master`, so that `RBAC_MODEL.md` §5 — "enforced by a database constraint rather than by
//! application logic alone" — is actually true.
//!
//! # What `m20260807_000007_add_api_key_master_marker` got wrong
//!
//! That migration added `master_marker VARCHAR(16) NULL` under a plain unique index and left
//! `bootstrap_master_key` responsible for writing `'master'` into it. The unique index is real, but
//! it constrains the *marker*, not `is_master` — and NULLs do not collide in a unique index on any
//! supported engine. So a writer that sets `is_master = true` and simply omits the marker is
//! accepted, and the database now holds two masters. That is not a hypothetical; it was demonstrated
//! against a live database built from those migrations:
//!
//! ```sql
//! INSERT INTO api_keys (id, name, key_hash, prefix, is_master, can_manage_keys,
//!                       can_manage_webhooks, can_create_groups, created_at, updated_at)
//! VALUES (x'…', 'Usurper', 'hash', 'usurper1', 1, 1, 1, 1, '…', '…');
//! -- Ok(ExecResult { changes: 1 })  →  2 rows now have is_master = true
//! ```
//!
//! The constraint held only for a writer that chose to cooperate, which is the definition of
//! "application logic alone". Every test that existed passed, because every test supplied the marker.
//!
//! # Why a generated column, and why still not a partial index
//!
//! The direct spelling remains unavailable: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX … ON api_keys (is_master) WHERE
//! is_master` needs partial indexes, which **MySQL does not have**, and `Cargo.toml` enables the
//! MySQL driver. The marker column is still the portable substitute. What changes is who writes it.
//!
//! `master_marker INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CASE WHEN is_master THEN 1 ELSE NULL END)` cannot be
//! assigned by anyone: every supported engine rejects an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` that targets a
//! generated column. The marker is therefore a pure function of `is_master`, evaluated by the
//! engine, and the unique index over it means a second `is_master = true` row is refused no matter
//! which client, migration, or `psql` session attempts it. The bypass above becomes a constraint
//! violation rather than a successful write.
//!
//! # Storage class is pinned per backend, and the pairing is unit-tested
//!
//! The one dialect split is `STORED` vs `VIRTUAL`:
//!
//! - **PostgreSQL** accepts only `STORED`; `VIRTUAL` arrived in PostgreSQL 18 and the floor here is
//!   older than that.
//! - **SQLite** accepts only `VIRTUAL` for a column added through `ALTER TABLE` — a `STORED` column
//!   would have to be materialized for existing rows, which `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` cannot do.
//! - **MySQL** accepts either; `VIRTUAL` is chosen because it avoids rewriting the table.
//!
//! Getting that pairing backwards produces a migration that works on the developer's SQLite and
//! fails on the operator's PostgreSQL at startup, so [`tests`] pins each backend's storage class.
//!
//! # A pre-existing second master stops the migration
//!
//! Checked before anything is altered, so an inconsistent database is left exactly as found rather
//! than half-migrated. The error names every offending row — id, name, and prefix — because a
//! database with two masters has no correct interpretation this migration could pick: which key is
//! legitimate is an operator's judgement. Failing loudly is recoverable in one `UPDATE`, and the
//! message says which one to run. (Creating the unique index would fail on its own anyway; the
//! explicit check exists to fail with an actionable message instead of a driver's constraint error.)
