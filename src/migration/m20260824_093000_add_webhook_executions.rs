//! Adds `webhook_executions`: one row per outbound HTTP attempt a webhook dispatch makes,
//! including retries — the delivery history the dashboard's "Executions" tab reads.
//!
//! # Why `webhook_id` is `ON DELETE CASCADE`, not `SET NULL`
//!
//! `audit_logs.api_key_id` is the precedent for a log table referencing a deletable row, and it uses
//! `SET NULL` specifically so the trail survives the key's deletion — `api_key_name`/`api_key_prefix`
//! are denormalized alongside it, so a nulled row still says *who* acted even after the key is gone.
//!
//! This table has no such denormalized identity for the webhook, and deliberately so: an execution
//! row is meaningless without knowing which webhook produced it, so a `SET NULL` row would be an
//! orphan with nothing left to attribute it to — worse than not existing. `SET NULL` would also break
//! the RBAC model outright: visibility here is entirely derived through `webhook_id ->
//! webhook_configs.owner_key_id` (there is no `owner_key_id` on this table itself — see
//! `api::webhooks::list_executions`), so a nulled `webhook_id` would make that row invisible to any
//! owner while remaining silently readable to Master, a leak in the opposite direction from what §4
//! asks for. `CASCADE` disposes of an execution row the moment its webhook can no longer own it,
//! which is also consistent with retention already bounding this table to a handful of hours or days
//! (see `retention::run_webhook_execution_retention_worker`) — the rows are operational history, not
//! data anyone is expected to keep past their webhook's own lifetime.
//!
//! # Why this is not pre-flight-inventoried under `RBAC_MODEL.md` §6
//!
//! §6 requires a key-deletion cascade to inventory "every resource and creator-private entity owned
//! by any key within [the subtree]" and refuse until each is resolved. An execution row is neither —
//! it carries no `owner_key_id`, confers no rights, and cannot itself be created or reassigned by a
//! caller. It is operational log data, governed the same way `audit_logs` already is (also absent
//! from pre-flight inventory, also not itself a managed resource or creator-private entity). Deleting
//! the *webhook* a key owns already goes through the existing ownership/lifecycle guard on
//! `webhook_configs`; its executions simply go with it via this cascade, the same way
//! `webhook_configs` rows already go with a deleted `ip_groups` row with no pre-flight step of their
//! own (`m20230101_000001_initial_schema`'s `ip_groups` -> `webhook_configs` cascade).
