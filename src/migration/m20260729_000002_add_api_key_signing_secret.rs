//! Adds `api_keys.signing_secret`, the per-key HMAC secret used to verify `X-Signature-256`.
//!
//! Added as a separate, additive migration rather than by editing the initial schema: the initial
//! migration has already run against existing databases, so changing it would leave those databases
//! silently missing the column (SeaORM would never re-run an already-applied migration).
//!
//! The column is **nullable** so this migration never fails on a table that already has rows.
//! Pre-existing keys therefore carry `NULL` and cannot produce a valid signature — the middleware
//! rejects them with `401` and a message pointing at `POST /api/keys/{id}/rotate`, which mints a
//! fresh secret. That is the intended migration path for an existing deployment, and it is a
//! deliberate choice over back-filling random secrets here: a secret generated inside a migration
//! could never be shown to its owner, so it would be unusable anyway.
