//! Renames the `BODY_ONLY` webhook auth mode to `HMAC_ONLY`, and makes the signature header
//! configurable.
//!
//! # Why rename
//!
//! `BODY_ONLY` named the *input* to the HMAC — the body, rather than a canonical string — and left
//! the more important half to be inferred: that this mode sends a signature and **nothing else**, no
//! `X-API-Key`, no bearer credential. Operators read the name as "sign the body, and whatever else we
//! normally send", which is the misreading that matters, because the whole point of choosing it is
//! that a receiver gets no reusable secret.
//!
//! The old spelling is still **parsed** (`AuthMode::BODY_ONLY_LEGACY`) so a client's stored
//! automation keeps working; it is simply never emitted again. This migration rewrites the stored
//! rows so the database agrees with the API.
//!
//! # Why the header and prefix become columns
//!
//! Both were hardcoded to `X-Signature-256` and `sha256=`. That is right for a peer instance of this
//! service and for `simply_hook_executor`, and wrong for a large share of third-party receivers:
//! GitHub-style consumers expect `X-Hub-Signature-256`, and some expect a bare hex digest with no
//! prefix at all. A receiver that cannot be configured to match had no way to accept our dispatches.
//!
//! Both columns are **nullable, defaulting to the previous hardcoded values at read time** rather
//! than being backfilled. Existing rows therefore keep their exact behaviour with no data rewrite,
//! and a NULL column reads as "whatever this service considers standard" rather than pinning a
//! historical choice into every old row.
//!
//! # What is deliberately *not* configurable: the algorithm
//!
//! The digest stays SHA-256. Making it selectable would mean accepting SHA-1 — the algorithm the
//! receivers that want a custom header name most often ask for — and this service would then be
//! generating signatures it knows to be forgeable, at the request of the least security-conscious
//! integration on the list. `crypto::SIGNATURE_PREFIX` and the inbound verifier are SHA-256
//! throughout, and `scripts/verify_convergence.sh` asserts that the prefix is mandatory rather than
//! stripped-if-present. A per-row algorithm column would be the one place that could quietly opt out.
