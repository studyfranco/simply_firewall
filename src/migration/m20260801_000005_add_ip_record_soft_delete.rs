//! Adds soft-delete columns to `ip_records`: `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by`.
//!
//! Deleting an IP record used to be irreversible, which made a mistyped `DELETE` — or a compromised
//! delegated key — permanently destructive. A soft delete keeps the row for a 92-day retention
//! window (`crate::retention`) during which a master key can inspect or restore it, after which it
//! is purged for real.
//!
//! Additive and defaulted, so every existing row becomes `is_deleted = false` — i.e. exactly the
//! visibility it already had. `is_deleted` is `NOT NULL` with a default rather than nullable: there
//! is no meaningful "unknown" state, and a nullable flag would force every read filter to spell out
//! `IS NULL OR = false`, which is the kind of condition that eventually gets one branch wrong.
//!
//! `deleted_by` is `TEXT` holding the acting key's UUID rather than a foreign key, matching
//! `SCHEMA.MD`. A FK would either block deleting that key later or null the attribution out via
//! `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and the point of an attribution field is that it survives the actor.
