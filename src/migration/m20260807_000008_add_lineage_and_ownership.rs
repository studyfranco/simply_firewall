//! Adds key lineage (`api_keys.parent_key_id`) and resource ownership (`owner_key_id` on
//! `ip_groups` and `webhook_configs`), plus the indexes `RBAC_MODEL.md` §7 requires.
//!
//! # What each column is for, and what it is emphatically not for
//!
//! - **`parent_key_id`** records which key created this one. §3/§6 use it for cascade deletion and
//!   §4 uses it for visibility scoping, and **R3 forbids deriving any authority from it**:
//!   "`parent_key_id` exists solely for cascading deletion and visibility scoping. A daughter of the
//!   Master key is an ordinary daughter key with no elevated standing. Rights are never derived from
//!   key lineage." No guard reads this column.
//! - **`owner_key_id`** records which key a resource belongs to. §3 gives Master and the owner —
//!   and nobody else — authority to delete or rename the entity itself. Holding `can_manage` or any
//!   operational verb confers none: "a parent that merely uses a resource must not be able to delete
//!   it."
//!
//! # Backfill: everything stays `NULL`, deliberately
//!
//! Existing rows have no recorded lineage or owner, and every candidate for inventing one is worse
//! than leaving it blank:
//!
//! - **Lineage.** Nothing in the schema records who created an existing key. `created_at` ordering
//!   would let us guess "the master created everything", which is usually true and occasionally very
//!   wrong — and a guessed subtree is a guessed *cascade*, so a wrong guess deletes keys nobody
//!   intended to delete when §6 lands.
//! - **Ownership.** `audit_logs` holds `GROUP_CREATE` and `WEBHOOK_CREATE` entries naming the acting
//!   key, which is tempting. It is not authoritative: the audit log is prunable by retention, its
//!   `api_key_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and groups created through the auto-provisioning paths
//!   predate any endpoint that logged them consistently. Reconstructing ownership from a lossy trail
//!   would hand lifecycle authority — the right to *delete a resource* — to whichever key happened
//!   to survive in a log row.
//!
//! `NULL` means "unassigned", and §3's authority test reads it as "no owner, therefore Master only".
//! That is a safe default: it withholds authority rather than inventing it, and a master can assign
//! ownership deliberately through `PUT /api/groups/{id}/owner` and `PUT /api/webhooks/{id}/owner`.
//!
//! # No database-level foreign keys on these three columns
//!
//! The other cross-table references in this schema carry real FKs, declared inside `CREATE TABLE` by
//! the initial migration. These three cannot: **SQLite has no `ALTER TABLE … ADD CONSTRAINT`**, and
//! `AGENT.MD` requires the data layer to stay SQL-agnostic across all three enabled backends. The
//! choice is a constraint that exists on PostgreSQL and MySQL and silently does not on the default
//! development backend — where every test in this repository runs — or no constraint and an explicit
//! application-level rule. A referential guarantee that holds in production and not in CI is worse
//! than none, because it is the CI run that would have caught the violation.
//!
//! So referential integrity is enforced in `src/api.rs` instead, in both directions:
//!
//! - **On assignment**, the referenced key is looked up before the column is written, so a dangling
//!   id cannot be introduced through the API.
//! - **On deletion**, `delete_api_key` nulls the `parent_key_id` of the deleted key's daughters and
//!   the `owner_key_id` of everything it owned — the application-level equivalent of
//!   `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and deliberately *not* `CASCADE`. §6 is explicit that "data is never
//!   destroyed implicitly": IP Groups and Webhook Configs "must never disappear as a side effect of
//!   removing a key". A `CASCADE` on `parent_key_id` would be worse still — it would delete an entire
//!   subtree the moment anyone ran a direct `DELETE`, bypassing the pre-flight inventory §6 requires.
//!   The recursive cascade is application logic gated on that inventory, not a schema behaviour.
//!
//! Reads stay defensive regardless: a resource whose `owner_key_id` names a key that no longer exists
//! is treated as unowned, which withholds authority rather than granting it to nobody in particular.
