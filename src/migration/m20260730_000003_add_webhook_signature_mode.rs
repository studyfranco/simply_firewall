//! Adds `webhook_configs.signature_mode`, selecting how outbound dispatches are signed.
//!
//! Additive and defaulted to `'BODY_ONLY'` — the exact behaviour every existing webhook already has
//! — so applying this migration changes nothing about how current webhooks are delivered. Opting a
//! webhook into `'CANONICAL_V1'` is an explicit, per-row decision, because it changes both the signed
//! message and the set of headers sent, which a third-party receiver would reject if flipped
//! underneath it.
//!
//! `NOT NULL` with a default (rather than nullable) keeps the entity a plain `String`: there is no
//! meaningful "unset" mode, and every dispatch must pick one.
