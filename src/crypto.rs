//! Request signing (HMAC-SHA256) and signing-secret encryption at rest (XChaCha20-Poly1305).
//!
//! Two distinct concerns live here, both keyed off an API key's `signing_secret`:
//!
//! 1. **Request authentication** — every `/api/*` call carries `X-API-Key` (identity lookup),
//!    `X-Timestamp` (anti-replay) and `X-Signature-256` (proof of possession). The signature is an
//!    HMAC-SHA256 over the **CANONICAL_V1** string `METHOD\nTARGET\nTIMESTAMP\nRAW_BODY` using the
//!    looked-up key's `signing_secret`, where `TARGET` is the **full request target including the
//!    query string**. See [`compute_signature`] and [`verify_signature`].
//!
//!    The same canonical string is used for outbound `CANONICAL_V1` webhook dispatches
//!    (`crate::webhooks`), so a `simply_ip_vault` instance can sign a request that another instance
//!    — or `simply_hook_executor` — verifies with identical code.
//! 2. **Secret confidentiality at rest** — unlike `key_hash` (a one-way hash), a `signing_secret`
//!    must be recoverable verbatim to verify a signature, so it cannot be hashed. It is therefore
//!    sealed with XChaCha20-Poly1305 under a key supplied out-of-band, so read access to the
//!    database alone is not enough to forge signatures. See [`SecretCipher`].
