//! Request signing (HMAC-SHA256) and signing-secret encryption at rest (XChaCha20-Poly1305).
//!
//! Two distinct concerns live here, both keyed off an API key's `signing_secret`:
//!
//! 1. **Request authentication** — every `/api/*` call carries `X-API-Key` (identity lookup),
//!    `X-Timestamp` (anti-replay) and `X-Signature-256` (proof of possession). The signature is an
//!    HMAC-SHA256 over the **CANONICAL_V1** string `METHOD\nTARGET\nTIMESTAMP\nRAW_BODY` using the
//!    looked-up key's `signing_secret`, where `TARGET` is the **full request target including the
//!    query string**. See [`compute_signature`] and [`verify_signature`].
//!
//!    The same canonical string is used for outbound `CANONICAL_V1` webhook dispatches
//!    (`crate::dispatch`), so a `simply_ip_vault` instance can sign a request that another instance
//!    — or `simply_hook_executor` — verifies with identical code.
//! 2. **Secret confidentiality at rest** — unlike `key_hash` (a one-way hash), a `signing_secret`
//!    must be recoverable verbatim to verify a signature, so it cannot be hashed. It is therefore
//!    sealed with XChaCha20-Poly1305 under a key supplied out-of-band, so read access to the
//!    database alone is not enough to forge signatures. See [`SecretCipher`].

///
/// # Why the query string is covered
///
/// `target` is the **full request target**, query string included. An earlier revision signed the

/// query parameters on `/api/*` were read-only filters. That second half stopped being true: `?hard=true`
/// on `DELETE /api/ips/{id}` escalates a reversible soft delete into an irreversible purge, and
/// `?include_deleted=true` widens `GET /api/ips` to the master trash view. With the query outside
/// the signed material, an on-path attacker who cannot forge a signature could still rewrite a
/// captured `DELETE /api/ips/{id}` into `…?hard=true` inside the replay window. Signing the whole
/// target closes that; a proxy that rewrites query strings must now be configured not to.
///
/// # Why the `sha256=` prefix is mandatory
///
/// `provided` must be exactly [`SIGNATURE_PREFIX`] followed by hex. A bare digest — 64 valid hex
/// characters with no tag — is refused, and that is a deliberate tightening of an earlier revision
/// which accepted both spellings.
///
/// The prefix names the algorithm, and an unlabelled digest is a field whose meaning depends on
/// something outside itself. Accepting both shapes cost more than it bought:
///
/// - **Agility.** The day a second algorithm is offered, every stored, logged, or transcribed bare
///   digest becomes ambiguous, and the compatibility shim needed to disambiguate them is exactly the
///   downgrade surface that makes algorithm confusion possible. Requiring the tag *now*, while
///   `sha256` is the only value it can take, is what makes adding a second one a non-event.
/// - **Convergence.** `simply_hook_executor` has always required the prefix, and the two services
///   authenticate to each other. Accepting a shape the peer rejects meant a request this service
///   would take was one the peer would refuse — a difference that shows up as a broken dispatch
///   rather than as a security finding, and so goes unnoticed until it breaks.
/// - **Cost.** None: `compute_signature` emits the prefix, so every caller using this crate's own
///   helper was already sending it.
///
/// This is a wire-format requirement, so a caller that hand-rolls the header (a `fail2ban` action, a
/// shell script) must send `X-Signature-256: sha256=<hex>` and not `<hex>` alone.

///
/// `Some(digest)` on success, carrying the **raw decoded digest bytes**, and `None` on any failure
/// (missing prefix, malformed hex, wrong tag width, wrong secret, tampered payload).
///
/// Returning the bytes rather than a bare `bool` is what lets [`crate::replay::ReplayGuard`] key on
