//! Shared plumbing every handler module leans on.
//!
//! This module exists because a handful of helpers are used by *three or more* of the handler
//! domains each — hashing a credential, normalising an address, writing an audit row, resolving a
//! group by id-or-name, formatting a reference for a log line. Pushing any of them into a domain
//! module would make every other domain depend on that one; leaving them in [`super`] made
//! `api/mod.rs` a 267-line file that was declarations, router surface, and a utility drawer at once.
//!
//! **Nothing here makes an authorization decision.** That is the boundary against [`super::guards`],
//! and it is testable rather than stylistic: no function in this file inspects *who* is calling or
//! returns a refusal that depends on the caller. A helper that starts deciding belongs in `guards`
//! instead — otherwise that module comes to mean "guards, plus everything else that happened to be
//! shared", which is the monolith problem again one level down.

/// `"anonymous"` / `"unknown"` when they are `None`. That would be strictly worse. A fallback string
/// makes an unattributed write *succeed*, so the first caller that has no key — a future background
/// job, a system event, a handler mounted outside `auth_middleware` — silently produces rows that
/// satisfy the constraint and attribute nothing. The column would be `NOT NULL` and the audit trail

/// runs behind [`crate::middleware::auth_middleware`], which resolves both before a handler sees the

/// never `None` in practice, only in the type.
