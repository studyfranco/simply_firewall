///   being trusted to fan its credential out to a new target.

/// # What is duplicated
///
/// Every configuration property: `target_url`, `group_id`, `auth_mode`, `signature_header`,
/// `signature_prefix`, `hmac_template`, `payload_template`, `headers_json`, `events`, `is_active`, and
/// `api_key`. `owner_key_id` is **not** copied — the clone is owned by the *caller*
/// ([`resource_owner`], the same rule every other creation endpoint follows), not by the source
/// webhook's owner, since the caller is the one asking for a new dispatch target to exist.
///
/// `secret_token` is deliberately **never** copied. Two webhooks sharing one HMAC secret means a
/// receiver able to verify one dispatch can verify the other, and a compromise of either target's
/// secret exposes both — the opposite of what cloning into a separate, independently editable webhook
