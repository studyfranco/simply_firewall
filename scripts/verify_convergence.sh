# verify_convergence.sh — mechanical drift detection between simply_ip_vault and
# simply_hook_executor.
#
# The two services deliberately share a small set of security primitives. Nothing in either build
# enforces that: they are separate crates with separate test suites, so the shared logic can drift
# apart one plausible-looking edit at a time and nobody notices until the next manual audit. This
# script is that audit, run cheaply and repeatably.
#
# It extracts the security-critical functions from both trees and diffs them, normalizing away the
# differences that are *expected* (crate names, the vault's `ProxyMatcher` vs the executor's
# `ProxySpec`, comment wording) so that only behavioural divergence surfaces.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: decide whether a divergence is wrong. Several are deliberate and documented —
# most importantly the authentication posture, which is asymmetric by design (see AGENT_NOTES.MD,
# "Convergence Parity Check"). A reported difference is a prompt to check the rationale, not a bug.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify_convergence.sh            # summary, exit 1 on unexpected divergence
#   scripts/verify_convergence.sh --verbose  # also print the normalized diffs
#
# Exit status: 0 when every tracked primitive matches (or diverges as documented), 1 otherwise.

# Adversarial coverage: every rule that claims a guarantee below the application must be proven
# against an *uncooperative* writer.
#
# This check exists because of a specific failure, and the failure is worth stating rather than
# summarizing. §5 required master uniqueness "enforced by a database constraint rather than by
# application logic alone". The schema had a `master_marker` column under a genuine unique index —
# but the application wrote the marker, and NULLs do not collide in a unique index, so any writer
# that set `is_master` and omitted the marker got a second master. It was accepted on a live
# database.
#
# Nothing caught it for six phases. `check_rule_coverage` above was green: §5 had a test. The test
# passed. Mutation testing fired: removing `.unique()` broke it. Every signal agreed, and every
# signal was blind for the same reason — the test supplied the marker itself. It proved a
# well-behaved writer behaves well, which is not what the rule was about.
#
# The generalisable form: a test that reaches the guarantee through the application can only ever
# prove the application's own habits. Where the claim is about the database, the type system, or an
# extractor, at least one test must go around the application entirely. That test is marked
# `ADVERSARIAL(§N)` in its doc comment, and this check fails when a rule listed below has none.
